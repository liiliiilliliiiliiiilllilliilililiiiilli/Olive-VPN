Mobile VPN app for Android.

  I created this app to have complete control over my online freedomâ€”without subscription or payment restrictions, ads, etc.
  The older version of the app was released and published in the Huawei AppGallery, but the newer version still needs some work before publication.
  I also tried to publish the app in RuStore, but it was rejected without explanation.
  If you clone a project, you need to unzip the `jniLibs/` folder of some libraries located in `./source/android/app/src/main/`.
